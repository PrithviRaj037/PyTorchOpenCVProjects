# PyTorchProjects
Tabular_Classification
Project Overview
Goal: Classify structured (tabular) data using a feedforward neural network in PyTorch.

Dataset: A synthetic or standard tabular dataset (e.g., from sklearn.datasets) with multiple features and a target label.

Framework: PyTorch
x_1_Tabular_Classification.ipynb: Complete Jupyter notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Model includes:

Data normalization

Train-test split

Custom dataset and dataloader creation

Model architecture definition

Loss function and optimizer

Accuracy metric and training loop

ðŸ“Š Key Techniques Used
PyTorch Tensors & Autograd

Feedforward Neural Network

Binary/Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss

SGD/Adam Optimizer

Accuracy Metric Calculation

Use of torch.utils.data.Dataset and DataLoader
